# RoomGen
A small program in Swift to automatically generate rooms for Dungeons and Dragons.

The program reads in a list of attributes and already generated rooms from a pair of json files. It provides the user with a number of commands for viewing existing rooms and generating new ones. When the user exits, the rooms json file is overwritten to include the new rooms.
